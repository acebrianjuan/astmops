## What is ASTMOPS?

ASTMOPS is an open source software written in C++ that calculates EUROCAE's ED-116 and ED-117 surveillance performance metrics for Surface Movement Radar (SMR) and Multilateration (MLAT) systems on any airport using the logged data from ASTERIX recordings.

The tool makes use of ADS-B references for Targets of Opportunity (TOO) analysis and can also take Differential GPS (DGPS) references for test vehicle or flight trial analysis.
